Building a Ping Pong Game 

Where to begin?

1. First create your index.html, styles.css and app.js under the same folder using your GitBash terminal. Keep in mind the following commands 
mkidir: creates folder 
touch: creates file 
cd: change directory 

2. Once the files are created in the terminal use the following command (code .) to open the newly created folder with files it should open with VS code if installed.

3. Add boilerplate to index.html and use a script tag to link app.js also use a link tag to link style.css

4. Once all the above has been completed proceed to create pseudocode. Assure yourself you understand the logic of the game. Can use the following as a resource as a reference.

5. Once all the above has been completed pick up that paddle! You're now ready to build this Ping Pong Game!  

The game should have the following 

1. Must have two players 
2. A win state
3. A lose state 
4. A way to keep playing if the game is not over 
5. Multiple rounds to play - a round must begin, end, and there must be a way to check if the game should continue or the overall game is won or lost

Let the Game Begin!!!
